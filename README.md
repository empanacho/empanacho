🤖:

- I don't like titles. So, instead of call me myself a Jr., Sr., etc, I prefer to say I'm a program writer.

- I don't call myself an engineer. I studied physics. I majored in physics. For better or for worse, I didn't majored in computer science.

- I write backend code in **Elixir**. 

- I love **Rust**, and **Elixir**.

- I have no issue in telling how great I've failed and how dummy I am.

🧑🏻:

- I speak English, Spanish, and can read broken French, German and Portuguese (W.I.P!).

- When I'm not coding, I:
  - Play boardgames.
  - Take walks, long walks.
  - Watch TV series and movies.
  - Read non-fiction books and graphic novels.
