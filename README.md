ü§ñ:

- I don't like titles. So, instead of call me myself a Jr., Sr., etc, I prefer to say I'm a Elixir/Rust developer.

- I don't call myself an Engineer. I studied physics. I majored in physics. For better or for worse, I didn't majored in computer science.

- I write backend code in **Elixir** and **Ruby**. 

- I love **Rust**, **Elixir** and **LFE**.

- I have no issue in telling how great I fail and how stupid I am.

- If you want to talk to me about how to conquer the galaxy (no joking), you can email me `email [at] aloui.se`.


üßëüèª:

- I speak English, Spanish, and can read broken French, German and Portuguese (W.I.P!).

- When I'm not coding, I:
  - Play boardgames.
  - Take walks, long walks.
  - Watch TV series and movies.
  - Read my feedly and non-fiction books.
